# Protocol::Rack

Provides abstractions for working with the Rack specification on top of [`Protocol::HTTP`](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-http). This would, in theory, allow you to run any `Protocol::HTTP` compatible application on top any rack-compatible server.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-rack/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/protocol-rack/actions?workflow=Test)

## Features

  - Supports Rack v2 and Rack v3 application adapters.
  - Supports Rack environment to `Protocol::HTTP::Request` adapter.

## Usage

### Application Adapter

Given a rack application, you can adapt it for use on `async-http`:

``` ruby
require 'async'
require 'async/http/server'
require 'async/http/client'
require 'async/http/endpoint'
require 'protocol/rack/adapter'

app = proc{|env| [200, {}, ["Hello World"]]}
middleware = Protocol::Rack::Adapter.new(app)

Async do
  endpoint = Async::HTTP::Endpoint.parse("http://localhost:9292")
  
  server_task = Async(transient: true) do
    server = Async::HTTP::Server.new(middleware, endpoint)
    server.run
  end
  
  client = Async::HTTP::Client.new(endpoint)
  puts client.get("/").read
  # "Hello World"
end
```

### Server Adapter

While not tested, in theory any Rack compatible server can host `Protocol::HTTP` compatible middlewares.

``` ruby
require 'protocol/http/middleware'
require 'protocol/rack'

# Your native application:
middleware = Protocol::HTTP::Middleware::HelloWorld

run proc{|env|
  # Convert the rack request to a compatible rich request object:
  request = Protocol::Rack::Request[env]
  
  # Call your application
  response = middleware.call(request)
  
  Protocol::Rack::Adapter.make_response(env, response)
}
```
