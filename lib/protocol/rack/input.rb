module Protocol

		# Wraps a streaming input body into the interface required by `rack.input`.
		#
		# The input stream is an `IO`-like object which contains the raw HTTP POST data. When applicable, its external encoding must be `ASCII-8BIT` and it must be opened in binary mode, for Ruby 1.9 compatibility. The input stream must respond to `gets`, `each`, `read` and `rewind`.
		#
		# This implementation is not always rewindable, to avoid buffering the input when handling large uploads. See {Rewindable} for more details.
		class Input
			# Initialize the input wrapper.
			# @parameter body [Protocol::HTTP::Body::Readable]

			# Rewind the input stream back to the start.
			#
			# `rewind` must be called without arguments. It rewinds the input stream back to the beginning. It must not raise Errno::ESPIPE: that is, it may not be a pipe or a socket. Therefore, handler developers must buffer the input data into some rewindable object if the underlying input stream is not rewindable.

			# @returns [Boolean] Whether the body could be rewound.
